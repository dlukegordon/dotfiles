* dotfiles

My personal dotfiles including configs for NixOS, emacs, and zsh.

** NixOS setup

- Download the latest [[https://nixos.org/download/][NixOS Plasma ISO]]
- Flash it to a USB drive
- Boot into it and install as normal. Be sure to pick the Plasma desktop environment and set the username to =luke=.
- TBD

** MacOS Setup

This is a work in progress. For now, refer to [[file:README-old.md][README-old.md]]. Eventually this will be implemented with [[https://github.com/LnL7/nix-darwin][nix-darwin]].

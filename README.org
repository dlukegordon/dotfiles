* dotfiles

My personal dotfiles including configs for nixos, emacs, tmux, wezterm, neovim, and zsh.

** Software

*** TODO list software

** NixOS setup (remote)

*** TODO Implement with nix-anywhere

** NixOS setup

*** Install the base os

- Download the latest [[https://nixos.org/download/][NixOS Plasma ISO]].
- Flash it to a USB drive.
- Boot into it and install as normal. Be sure to pick the Plasma 6 desktop environment and set the username to =luke=.

*** Prepare the system for setup

We are in a fresh NixOS system, but we must do a few things before we can clone this repo and install everything. These commands will setup the necessary packages and settings.

#+begin_src bash
curl -o ~/Downloads/configuration.nix "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dlukegordon/dotfiles/master/nixos/setup/configuration.nix"
sudo cp ~/Downloads/configuration.nix /etc/nixos/configuration.nix
sudo nixos-rebuild switch
#+end_src

*** Install the full system

We can now install the full system. These commands will clone the repo, link the dotfiles into =~=, apply the NixOs configuration, setup asdf, and install Doom emacs. Set =new_host= to the hostname for the configuration from [[file:nixos/flake.nix][flake.nix]] you are installing.

#+begin_src bash
new_host="<set hostname from flake.nix>"
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/dlukegordon/dotfiles.git
cd dotfiles
make install host=$new_host
reboot
#+end_src

After the reboot, make sure to select an X11 session on the SDDM screen. Wayland is not currently supported.

*** Post install

There are a few things that we can't (currently) setup through NixOS, you'll need to set these up manually.
- Setup Librewolf extensions like Bitwarden, Tree Style Tabs, uBlock.
- Customize Librewolf settings such as search engines, search shortcuts, and appearance (theme is already installed).
- Customize the Plasma panel and task switcher settings.
- Set Plasma display, power, and screen lock settings.
- Generate an ssh key for git. Follow instructions [[https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent][here]]. Then you'll need to update the remote of this reo to use ssh: =git remote set-url origin git@github.com:dlukegordon/dotfiles.git=.

** MacOS Setup

This is a work in progress. For now, refer to [[file:README-old.md][README-old.md]]. Eventually this will be implemented with [[https://github.com/LnL7/nix-darwin][nix-darwin]].
